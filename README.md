# Machine Learning Assignments

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Assignments** repository! This repository contains a collection of assignments and projects I've completed as part of the lesson "Applied Machine Learning". Each assignment focuses on different aspects of ML, including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and more.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- **ML-assignments/**
  - **1st Assignment/**
    - `assignment1.ipynb`  - Code file
    - **data/** - Folder that contains all datasets
      - **Amsterdam/** - Dataset folder for Amsterdam
        - `listings.csv` - Dataset used
      - ...
  - **2nd Assignment/**

## üìù Assignments Overview

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the assignments included in this repository:

### 1. **Assignment 1: Exploring AirBnB in Europe**
   - **Description**: This assignment involves analyzing Airbnb data across 13 European cities, focusing on listings, densities, booking activities, and income, while also comparing findings with publicly available data and creating interactive visualizations.
   - **Key Concepts**: Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Visualization, Interactive Dashboards, Occupancy Rates, Booking Calculations, Income Estimation, Cross-Validation with External Data, and Comparative Analysis.

### 2. **Assignment 2: Social Media Sanctions and Misinformation Sharing**
   - **Description**: This assignment investigates whether social media sanctions are politically biased by analyzing data on misinformation sharing and political orientation, using statistical methods like t-tests, PCA, and regression models (probit and logit) to predict account suspensions.
   - **Key Concepts**: Crosstabulation & Chi-Square Test, Distributions & Standardization, T-Test & Effect Sizes, Correlation Analysis, Probit & Logit Regression, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), Bonferroni & Holm-Bonferroni Corrections, Winsorization, Log Transformations, and Interpretation of Results.

### 3. **Assignment 3: SemEval 2025 Task 9 - The Food Hazard Detection Challenge**
   - **Description**: This assignment involves developing explainable classification systems for detecting food hazards and products from incident report titles using RoBERTa models, with tasks including text classification (ST1) and exact hazard/product detection (ST2), evaluated using macro F1 scores.
   - **Key Concepts**: Text Classification, Vector Detection, RoBERTa Models, Explainability, Evaluation Metrics, Data Preprocessing, Label Encoding, Model Training & Evaluation, and Prediction & Submission.
